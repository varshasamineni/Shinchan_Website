    <h1>Shinchan</h1>
    <p>
      Shinnosuke Nohara (野原しんのすけ), also known as Shinchan or Shin, is the
      protagonist of Crayon Shin-chan. He is the son of Hiroshi and Misae. His
      nickname is "Shin-chan" Nohara and he is Himawari's brother, a
      kindergarten-aged boy whose antics are the basis for the series. He is 5
      years old and yet acts overtly mature. In general, he is brutally honest,
      highly curious, and has no shame whatsoever. Ironically, there have been
      several instances in which Shinnosuke's own crazy antics actually solved
      the problems of those around him. Whether this is the result of his own or
      purely accidental is debatable. Adding to that, he also displays a
      surprising amount of talent and ability in various activities (running,
      surfing, kendo, fishing, skiing, swimming and others).
